Register 0x32 to Register 0x37—DATAX0, DATAX1, DATAY0, DATAY1, DATAZ0, DATAZ1 (Read Only)
These six bytes (Register 0x32 to Register 0x37) are eight bits each and hold the output data for each axis.
Register 0x32 and Register 0x33 hold the output data for the x-axis, Register 0x34 and Register 0x35 hold the output data for the y-axis, and Register 0x36 and Register 0x37 hold the output data for the z-axis. 
The output data is twos complement, with DATAx0 as the least significant byte and DATAx1 as the most significant byte, where x represent X, Y, or Z. 
The DATA_FORMAT register (Address 0x31) controls the format of the data. 
It is recommended that a multiple-byte read of all registers be performed to prevent a change in data between reads of sequential registers.


Register 0x31—DATA_FORMAT (Read/Write)
Table 34. Register 0x31
D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0
SELF_TEST SPI INT_INVERT 0 FULL_RES Justify Range

The DATA_FORMAT register controls the presentation of data to Register 0x32 through Register 0x37.
All data, except that for the ±16 g range, must be clipped to avoid rollover.

SELF_TEST Bit
A setting of 1 in the SELF_TEST bit applies a self-test force to the sensor, causing a shift in the output data. 
A value of 0 disables the self-test force.

SPI Bit
A value of 1 in the SPI bit sets the device to 3-wire SPI mode, and a value of 0 sets the device to 4-wire SPI mode.

INT_INVERT Bit
A value of 0 in the INT_INVERT bit sets the interrupts to active high, and a value of 1 sets the interrupts to active low.

FULL_RES Bit
When this bit is set to a value of 1, the device is in full resolution mode, where the output resolution increases with the g range set by the range bits to maintain a 4 mg/LSB scale factor. When the FULL_RES bit is set to 0, the device is in 10-bit mode, and the range bits determine the maximum g range and scale factor. 

Justify Bit
A setting of 1 in the justify bit selects left-justified (MSB) mode, and a setting of 0 selects right-justified mode with sign extension.

Range Bits
These bits set the g range.
0 0 ±2 g
0 1 ±4 g
1 0 ±8 g
1 1 ±16 g

________
Further study of the data sheet shows:-
When the FULL_RES bit is set to 0, the device is in 10-bit mode, and the range bits determine the maximum g range and scale factor.

Register 0x32 to Register 0x37 (DATAX0-DATAZ1)
These … are eight bits each and hold the output data for each axis.
The output data is twos complement. 

Register 0x31 (DATA_FORMAT)
When the FULL_RES bit is … 0, the device is in 10-bit mode

This implies 2**10 // 4 i.e. 256 is the divisor needed to convert the integral value to a g value.    # acceleration conversion factor (10-bit resolution ±2g) 
This implies that the 10 bit value represents 4g so each bit corresponds to g//256
